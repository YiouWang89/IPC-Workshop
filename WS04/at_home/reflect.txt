For this workshop 4, I have learned how to declare an array, how to assign a value to each element in the array. For using array, the good thing is that you can store a bunch of values in it, and when you need one of the values in your code, just call it from array with the right position. If there are no array, you have to declare numbers of variables. For example, you can have array1[26]={a,b,c,….,z}, however, if there are no array, you have to declare a1=a, a2=b, a3=c, …, a26=z. It is much complicate than have an array to instore the same type of values. For Parallel, it is useful when you need two kinds of values on one item. In this work shop, we need the high temperature and low temperature in the same day, parallel arrays solve this perfectly. High_tem[0] and Low_tem[0], store the temperature for same day, so it makes easy to calculate the average temperature. At the last part of this workshop, we are asked to get the average temperature, so I declare a variable sum_temp, and use for loop to get the sum_temp. However, after the first 3 days, I could not get the right answer,  so I debug. It is because for loop is a nest loop in do while, when the loop goes to 2nd time, the sum_temp is not 0, it add the last result in the new loop. So this experience tell me it is best to initialize variables to 0.
