For workshop2, I feel a little bit difficult compared with workshop1. In_lab part is OK, but In_home part it took me for a while to write the code.

I am an International student, so the interesting part is to learn Canadian money, Lonnies, Quaeters etc. The most difficult part for me is to figure out how to round. When I wrote In_home part, required Pennies was 0, it took me a long time to find out how to round and get the right output 1 pennies.

I believe it is a best practice to convert floating-point to integers, watching instruction videos and practice by myself is different. The value for Lonnies or Quaeters are floating-point, but the number of them are integers, so this workshop makes me get more familiar with convert different data type by asking number of coins and balance.

Using modulus operator makes code short and much more readable. For example, in the code, I can use modulus operator to get how many pennies I need, but when I need balance owing, I have to write a long expression include subtraction multiplication to get the balance.

This workshop is very helpful. Thank you, professor.
