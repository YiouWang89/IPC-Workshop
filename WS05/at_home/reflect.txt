For workshop 5, I learn how to use a struct array, how to get the value in the struct array, and get more familiar with iteration. I believe in workshop 5, using an array of structs is much easier than using parallel arrays. 

Parallel arrays can only store the same type of variables. In this case, the employees' ID and age are integers, but the salary is float. If we are going to declare parallel arrays, there have to be three arrays, declare array1 for ID, array2 for age, and array3 for salary. This will makes the code more complex. Instead of declaring  3 parallel arrays, we can use the struct array to store 3 kinds of information in the different types.  We can also store an array in a struct array, this is what parallel arrays can't do.

Except for declared the struct at the top of the code, we can also declare it in a special file called a header file. After we store the declaration of a struct in a head file, we can insert it in the source file. The advantage of declaring struct in the head file is that if you want to use this struct in other c files, you can use the head file without typing it again, and if you want to change the struct, just change one spot alone.
